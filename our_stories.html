          In 2022, Sarah adopted Max, a shy golden retriever who had been
          abandoned. Max was timid and hesitant at first, but with Sarah's love
          and patience, he has blossomed into a playful and affectionate
          companion, always by her side.

          Two years ago, Emily adopted Peanut, a rabbit who had been surrendered
          due to its previous owner's allergies. Peanut was quiet and anxious,
          but today he happily hops around Emily’s garden, enjoying a peaceful,
          loving home.
        </li>

          Last summer, James adopted Luna, a stray kitten found on the streets.
          Luna was sick and frail, but after months of care, she’s now a
          healthy, curious cat who loves lounging on James's lap, bringing joy
          to his everyday life.
